NeuroMorph is a toolset designed to import, analyze, and visualize mesh models in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It has been developed specifically for the morphological analysis of 3D objects derived from serial electron microscopy images of brain tissue, but much of its functionality can be applied to any 3D mesh.  These mesh objects can be generated by any 3D image segmentation software, such as [ilastik](http://ilastik.org/) or [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji).
