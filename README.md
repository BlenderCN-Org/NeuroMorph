NeuroMorph is a toolset designed to import, analyze, and visualize mesh models. It has been designed specifically for the morphological analysis of 3D objects derived from serial electron microscopy images of brain tissue, although much of its functionality can be applied to any 3D mesh.  These models can be generated by software that allows the images to be segmented so that 3D objects can be built.  These objects can be generated by any 3D image segmentation software, such as ilastik or Fiji.  The NeuroMorph toolset has been developed as a set of add-ons for Blender, a widely used free and open source 3D modeling software package.

Here you can download the latest version of the NeuroMorph add-ons for Blender, and also example meshes, objects, and image files for use with the add-ons.
