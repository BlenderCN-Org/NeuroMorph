### NeuroMorph Toolkit

Download the lastest version of the Blender add-ons from the [**NeuroMorph_Toolkit**](https://github.com/ajorstad/NeuroMorph/raw/master/NeuroMorph_Toolkit) folder.

Example meshes, objects, and image files for use with the add-ons are available in the [**NeuroMorph_Samples**](https://github.com/ajorstad/NeuroMorph/raw/master/NeuroMorph_Samples) folder.

### Description
NeuroMorph is a toolset designed to import, analyze, and visualize mesh models in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It has been developed specifically for the morphological analysis of 3D objects derived from serial electron microscopy images of brain tissue, but much of its functionality can be applied to any 3D mesh.  These mesh objects can be generated by any 3D image segmentation software, such as [ilastik](http://ilastik.org/) or [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji).

### Measuring Synapse-Vesicle Density *(new)*
Given a 3D mesh representation of a synapse and balls marking the synaptic vesicles, this plug-in computes and outputs the closest distance from each vesicle to the synapse.  See the [**NeuroMorph_Density_Measurements**](https://github.com/ajorstad/NeuroMorph/raw/master/NeuroMorph_Density_Measurements) folder.
