#### NeuroMorph Centerline Processing   ([download](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajorstad/NeuroMorph/master/NeuroMorph_CenterLines_CrossSections/NeuroMorph_Centerline_Processing.py))
This module processes center lines generated by [VMTK](http://www.vmtk.org/tutorials/Centerlines.html), and performs calculations in Blender using these center lines.  It includes a tool to clean meshes, to export meshes for VMTK, and to import center lines generated by VMTK.  It also includes a tool to generate cross-sectional surfaces and surface areas of the mesh along the center line, and a tool to project vesicle objects onto the center line.  This data can be exported for analysis.
